# Week 1 Deliverable

### Instructions

In order to deliver homework consisting of questions and answers, just edit this file and commit the changes.  Once your answers are on Github, specifically in this file, you have delivered your homework.

To answer questions, please just put the answer on the next line after the question.  Put a blank line after the answer to separate it visually from the next question.

Example:

**What is your name?**
Christian Dean

**What is your quest?**
I want to learn more about code and how to utilize tools to make my business succeed.

**What is your favorite color?**
Green is my favorite color!

For projects on Code Academy, or other external exercises, please just paste a link into your deliverables file where we can see the result.

### Section 1: The Front End
#### Required - Answer these questions in the deliverables file, and complete the following.

What is the role of HTML in a web page?
HTML is the language, or code, used to edit and position the text, images, frames and other web page elements. Its purely for content.
What is the role of CSS in a web page?
CSS is an enhanced form of HTML, and makes it easier to edit the design of a web page.
What is the role of Javascript in a web page?
Java script primarily to make a website more active or visual, it can not go without html / css and works with it but is seperate from html and css.

### Section 2: HTML and CSS 101

#### meta
Why do we separate HTML and CSS?

That way it is easy to distinguish the content we are editing rather than the design of the code.
#### HTML
What are classes and IDs (and how are they different)?
ID's are unique throughout the code and allow you to label and edit one aspect while Classes are not unique and allow you to access and edit more than one portion of code at a time.

What are elements?
Elements are used to organize the components of code in a web page. They always have two tags, a beginning and end.

What are tags?
Tags are used to define the HTML and apply something to the content.

What are attributes?
There are many different kind of attributes that can go inside a tag to modify the current tag.

What are forms?
Forms are used within webpages to make the website more interactive and gather information, it takes some kind of information and sends it to some kind of database.

What is a div?
Div tag works as a container for HTML code and can be used to combine / label code.

What are selectors?
In CSS, selectors are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style.

What are properties?
Code can have properties just like a dog has fur, a tail, and eye color.

What are values?
The variable name is the usual way to reference the stored value; this separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer source code can be bound to a value during run time, and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of program execution

How do CSS styles for a particular element get inherited? ie. how does an element get its "default" styles?
The idea behind inheritance is relatively easy to understand. Elements inherit styles from their parent container. If you set the body tag to use color: red then the text for all elements inside the body will also be red unless otherwise specified.

What are two CSS attributes you can change to push an element around on the page?
An absolutely positioned element is always relative to the next positioned parent. If there isn't a parent element, the containment block is used instead. Values for left and top are relative to the upper-left corner of the next positioned element in the hierarchy. For example, to place an image at the top left corner of the document, set the attributes to 0.  Fixed positioning is also another attribute you can add to an element.

What are the three different ways to include CSS in your project or use CSS to style a particular element?
CSS can be used to move an element, change design, or edit a web page.

### Section 3: Git and Github
What is Git?
Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of.

What is SCM?
A source code manager (SCM) is a software tool used by teams of programmers to manage source code.
SCMs are used to track revisions in software. Each revision is given a timestamp and includes the name of the person who is responsible for the change. Various revisions may be compared, stored, and merged with other revisions.

What is a VCS?
Revision control, also known as version control and source control (and an aspect of software configuration management), is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision". For example, an initial set of files is "revision 1". When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2", and so on. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.

Why is Git useful for a developer?
It is a way to organize and develop your code.

Why is Git useful for a team of developers?
Code can be managed and edited online to allow a team to work together

How do you create a new Git repository for a project locally?
first takes an existing project or directory and imports it into Git. The second clones an existing Git repository from another server.

How do you create it on Github?
In the upper-right corner of any page, click , and then click New repository.

How do you commit changes?
At the bottom of the code page as long as you are owner of the code you can commit changes or suggest them.

What is the difference between staging and committing changes?


Stage to Commit would be for a file that already has changes being tracked which you've since altered. You would generally only "add" a file once to begin tracking changes, and thereafter you would simply stage the file for commit that you've changed.

What is the difference between committing your changes and pushing them to Github?

Creating a commit is like saving a file—you are telling Git that you’d like to remember this point in history.Click the “Publish” button in the upper-right corner and GitHub Desktop will ask you what kind of repository to create:

What is the command to check the status of your current repo in git?

Git Status

What is the command to see the history of your previous commits (from the command line)?  What are a few interesting variations (sets of options)?

Git Log

How can you look through your historical commits on the Github website?

Git Log

What is a "Merge"?

Merge a Branch or two different repos

What is a "Pull Request"?

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository.

What is "Forking" a repo?

Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

What is "Cloning" a repo?

Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository
